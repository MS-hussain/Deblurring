# Deblurring
Deblur images using a CNN model. Train on 7530 pairs of clear and blurred images for sharp results.
# Image Deblurring with CNNs

Image deblurring is a fundamental task in computer vision and image processing. This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for the purpose of restoring clear images from blurred inputs. The model is trained on a dataset of 7530 paired clear and blur images, with the goal of learning to remove blur and produce high-quality, clear images.

## Key Features

- A deep learning model architecture for image deblurring.
- Training on a large dataset of clear and blur image pairs.
- Code organized into separate cells for clarity and ease of execution.
- Model evaluation using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM).
- Testing the model on specific images for visual assessment.
